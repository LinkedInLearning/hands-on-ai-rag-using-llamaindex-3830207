    "\n",
    "That's why data preparation and cleaning are important steps to ensure high-quality results. **This course purposefully uses simple PDF files, specifically books, to demonstrate the process.** There's so much to data preparation for RAG that I could write another two-hour course just on that topic. However, it's important to acknowledge that real-world PDFs and other documents can be much more complex, requiring additional processing and cleaning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for data prep\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📜 **Document Content**: Utilize text from documents for keyword searches or to find similar content in RAG applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📑 **Document Elements**: Break down documents into fundamental parts to assist in RAG tasks like filtering and segmenting, like:\n",
    "  - Titles\n",
    "  - Narrative text\n",
    "  - List items\n",
    "  - Tables\n",
    "  - Images\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🏷 **Element Metadata**: Provide additional details for each document element to support hybrid search and track information origin, such as:\n",
    "  - Filename\n",
    "  - Filetype\n",
    "  - Page number\n",
    "  - Section\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔄 **Summary**: Explains document preprocessing for retrieval systems, focusing on transforming documents into searchable elements and metadata.\n",

Whatever you picked, my advice to you would be to raise it. Like I said, for myself, even before I had money, for the longest time I used $5,000 an hour. And if you extrapolate that out into what it looks like as an annual salary, its multiple millions of dollars per year. Ironically, I actually think Ive beaten it. Im not the hardest working personIm actually a lazy person. I work through bursts of energy where Im really motivated with something. If I actually look at how much Ive earned per actual hour that Ive put in, its probably quite a bit higher than that. Can you expand on your statement, If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you? If you get into a relative mindset, youre always going to hate people who do better than you, youre always going to be jealous or envious of them. Theyll sense those feelings when you try and do business with them. When you try and do business with somebody, if you have any bad thoughts or any judgments about them, they will feel it. Humans are wired to feel what the other person deep down inside feels. You have to get out of a relative mindset. Literally, being anti-wealth will prevent you from becoming wealthy, because you will not have the right mindset for it, you wont have the right spirit, and you wont be dealing with people on the right level. Be optimistic, be positive. Its important. Optimists actually do better in the long run.',\n",

       " 'text': 'UNDERSTAND HOW WEALTH IS CREATED I like to think that if I lost all my money and you dropped me on a random street in any English-speaking country, within five or ten years Id be wealthy again because its just a skillset Ive developed that anyone can develop. Its not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and youre not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you cant skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way. If you dont know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on. I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. Ive been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and Ive been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth. This is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of course, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an hours worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good starting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense, very concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the information and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard over ten years, youll get what you want.',\n",
